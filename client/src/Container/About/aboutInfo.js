  info: `In the short amount of time that I have known you. I have come to realized how much of a selfess and caring person you are to other people.\
  You are always willing to place other needs before your's and that is what I love most about you. You are also determined to go back to school, to get\
  your nursing degree. I understand how stressed out you are at this moment, but I'm sure it will all paid off in the long run as long as you don't quit and give \
  up halfway through the program. I hope that you receive the best wishes on your birthday and more. I understand that sometimes I do not express myself as much as \
  you would like for me to, but that is something that I am working on, so I truly hope that you understand. And I would love to see you come back to the bubbly person \
  that you told me that you once were. I mean, not saying that you're not as bubbly now since you did tell me how much more bubbly you we're back then. \
  Again, I hope you enjoy this gift. I know this section was supposed to be all about you and how great you are and blah blah blah... But I ain't no simp loool.
  I love you baby. I wish you have the best boopday.`,
